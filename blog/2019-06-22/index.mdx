Recently, I took a decision to create a
[React datepicker](https://tresko.dev/yet-another-datepicker-in-react) to reduce a bundle size and
also to speed up theming.

## The problem

Having a datepicker component that you can reuse is great, but it presents a few problems, least of
which is how to change their styling to adapt to a new theme. You’ve probably come across this
problem many times. You have a datepicker that you want to use in another project. It should work
the same, but you want to have different color palette, which will match to the rest of website
design.

Let’s start by thinking about how can we theme our datepicker. Maybe we can style it using external
CSS, but in my opinion that is not the best solution. Class names might change in the future, so the
look of the datepicker will no longer be the same.

Can we find a solution?

## Starting the solution

There are a multitude of technologies available to style your React components using CSS. We want
something that allows us to easily deal with things like hover states and media queries as well as
allowing us to change our styles based on the props that we pass to our datepicker.

Luckily this is exactly what [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is great for.
But that is not the end. The [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) take theming in
`styled-components` even to a higher level.

Styled System is one of the best libraries I have ever used. Therefore is a logical choice for
theming the [@datepicker-react/styled](https://github.com/tresko/react-datepicker) library. 

Why? Styled System enables to style consistently with a global theme, respond to changing requirements
quickly and create mobile-first responsive layouts with ease.

## Design constraints theme

We define our theme as a object and then provide it using the `ThemeProvider` component. This
component provides a theme to all React components underneath itself via the context API. In the
render tree all styled-components will have access to the provided theme, even when they are
multiple levels deep.

```jsx harmony
<ThemeProvider
  theme={{
    breakpoints: ['32em', '48em', '64em'],
    reactDatepicker: {
      daySize: [36, 40],
      fontFamily: 'system-ui, -apple-system',
      colors: {
        accessibility: '#D80249',
        selectedDay: '#f7518b',
        selectedDayHover: '#F75D95',
        primaryColor: '#d8366f',
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <DateRangeInput {...props} />
</ThemeProvider>
```

In the example code above we apply a theme to the `ThemeProvider`. As we mentioned earlier,
`@datepicker-react/styled` use `styled-system` for theming, which make it simpler to use values from
a theme and apply styles responsively across breakpoints.

That's why the theme object contains breakpoints key. All datepicker styles are located in
`datepickerReact` object. If we look closely to the `daySize` key, we see that it is an array, which
includes two numbers. In practice, that means that the day has the size of 36 pixels if the window
is narrower than 32em. If the window is wider than 32em, the `daySize` size is 40 pixels.

That's not all, you can change the color palette with ease. You just need to provide the `colors`
object to the `reactDatepicker` object.

There are a variety of available styles.
