Yet another datepicker in React, ha? But why, if you can use `react-dates`. Of course, it is a great library if you already use the `moment`, which is a widely used library for date and time manipulations. But the problem of the `moment` is its size. That's why I decided to create my own datepicker. 

## Motivation
 - Accept JavaScript date, instead `moment`,
 - RTL support,
 - internationalize,
 - mobile-friendly,
 - allow selecting a specific date or range
 - theming with styled-system
 - written in TypeScript
 - etc.

## Architecture

I wanted the datepicker to be used in as many scenarios, so I split the project into two libraries [`@datepicker-react/hooks`](https://github.com/tresko/react-datepicker/tree/master/packages/hooks) and [`@datepicker-react/styled`](https://github.com/tresko/react-datepicker).

## @datepicker-react/hooks

[`@datepicker-react/hooks`](https://github.com/tresko/react-datepicker/tree/master/packages/hooks) are React hooks (if you are not familiar with React hooks, check out [this article](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)), which allow building the datepicker or a calendar according to your needs in a few minutes. The library contains three hooks, namely `useDatepicker`, `useMonth` and `useDay`.

### Install

```
yarn add @datepicker-react/hooks
```

### useDatepicker

This hook is alpha and omega of the [`@datepicker-react/hooks`](https://github.com/tresko/react-datepicker/tree/master/packages/hooks). It manages the datepicker logic. You can control the selected dates using the `startDate`, `endDate`, and `onDatesChange` props as shown below. 

```js
const {
    activeMonths,
    isDateSelected,
    isFirstOrLastSelectedDate,
    isDateHovered,
    firstDayOfWeek,
    onDateSelect,
    onResetDates,
    goToPreviousMonths,
    goToNextMonths,
    numberOfMonths,
    hoveredDate,
    onDateHover,
    isDateFocused,
    focusedDate,
    onDateFocus,
    isDateBlocked,
} = useDatepicker({
    startDate: new Date(2019, 1, 1),
    endDate: new Date(2019, 1, 10),
    focusedInput: null,
    onDatesChange: (props) => {
      console.log(props)
    },
})
```

### useMonth

`useMonth` returns the array of `days`, `weekDayLabels` and `monthLabel`, depends on the `year` and `month` props.

```js
const {
    days,
    weekdayLabels,
    monthLabel,
} = useMonth({
    year: 2019,
    month: 1,
})
```

### useDay

Returns callbacks and flags, which we need for styling.

```js
const {
    tabIndex,
    isSelected,
    isSelectedStartOrEnd,
    isWithinHoverRange,
    disabledDate,
    onKeyDown,
    onClickk,
    onMouseEnter,
} = useMonth({
     date,
    focusedDate,
    isDateSelected,
    isDateFocused,
    isFirstOrLastSelectedDate,
    isDateHovered,
    isDateBlocked,
    onDateSelect,
    onDateFocus,
    onDateHover,
    dayRef,
})
```

## @datepicker-react/styled

An easily internationalizable, accessible, mobile-friendly datepicker library for the web, build with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/). It supports RTL and theming with [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system).

### Install

```sh
yarn add @datepicker-react/styled styled-components
```

### Include components

```js
import {DateRangeInput, DateSingleInput, Datepicker} from '@datepicker-react/styled'
```

### DateRangeInput example

The `DateRangeInput` is a fully controlled component that allows users to select a date range. You
can control the selected dates using the `startDate`, `endDate`, and `onDatesChange` props as shown
below. Similarly, you can control which input is focused as well as calendar visibility (the
calendar is only visible if `focusedInput` is defined) with the `focusedInput` and `onFocusChange`
props as shown below.

Here is the minimum _REQUIRED_ setup you need to get the `DateRangeInput` working:

```jsx
import React, {useReducer} from 'react'
import {DateRangeInput} from '@datepicker-react/styled'

const initialState = {
  startDate: null,
  endDate: null,
  focusedInput: null,
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'focusChange':
      return {...state, focusedInput: action.payload}
    case 'dateChange':
      return action.payload
    default:
      throw new Error()
  }
}

function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  return (
    <DateRangeInput
      onDatesChange={data => dispatch({type: 'dateChange', payload: data})}
      onFocusChange={focusedInput => dispatch({type: 'focusChange', payload: focusedInput})}
      startDate={state.startDate} // Date or null
      endDate={state.endDate} // Date or null
      focusedInput={state.focusedInput} // START_DATE, END_DATE or null
    />
  )
}
```
