Yet another datepicker in React, ha? But why, if you can use `react-dates`. Of course, it is a great library if you already use the `moment` and you don't concern about bundle size. Its size, plus size of peer dependencies is 130kB (minified + gzip). That's why I decided to make my own datepicker.

## Motivation
 - a smaller library that will not be used the moment,
 - RTL support,
 - internationalize,
 - mobile-friendly,
 - allow selecting a specific date or range
 - theming with styled-system
 - etc.

## Architecture

I wanted the datepicker to be used in as many scenarios, so I split the project into two libraries `@datepicker-react/hooks` and `@datepicker-react/styled`.

## @datepicker-react/hooks

@datepicker-react/hooks are React hooks, which allow building the datepicker or a calendar according to your taste in a few minutes. If you are not familiar with React hooks, check out [this article](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
